# Requirements
•    Accepts two strings as input: one string is called "text" and the other is called "subtext" in this problem statement,
•    Matches the subtext against the text, outputting the character positions of the beginning of each match for the subtext within the text.
•    Allows multiple matches
•    Allows case insensitive matching
•    Unit Testing

# Sample

# Assumptions
App can be generated and boilerplate used
Testing tool can be of any type
Can use anything to split output for multiple search matching
Output can be listed in any way, current listing downwards could be changed to a simple string output
Can use pure css and material ui as neccesary
